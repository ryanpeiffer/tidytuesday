This repository holds my code for analysis I've done on Tidytuesday datasets.

Tidytuesday is a community that posts a dataset to explore and visualize on
a weekly basis. If you haven't heard of it, you definitely [should](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).

If you want to see the completed Markdown reports produced by the code in this
repository, you can view them at [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/ryanpeiffer/).
